## Team Roles
Here are the key roles involved in the AirBnB Clone Project and their responsibilities:

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic. They create APIs, handle authentication, and ensure communication between the database and the front end.
### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
In charge of designing, maintaining, and optimizing the database. Ensures data is stored securely, performs backups, and monitors performance.
### 3. DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and server management. Ensures the application runs smoothly in development, staging, and production environments.
### 5. Project Manager
Oversees the entire project, tracks progress, coordinates the team, and ensures deadlines and goals are met.
### 6. QA Engineer
Tests the application for bugs, usability issues, and performance problems. Ensures the final product is stable and reliable.


## Technology Stack

Here is a list of technologies used in the AirBnB Clone Project and their purpose:

### 1. Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the back-end of the application. It helps handle routing, user authentication, and serves as the foundation for building RESTful APIs.

### 2. Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that makes it easy to build powerful RESTful APIs. It handles common tasks like serialization, permissions, and viewsets.

### 3. PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and payments.

### 4. GraphQL
An alternative to REST APIs that allows the client to request exactly the data it needs. It makes queries more efficient and flexible.

### 6. Git & GitHub
Version control tools used to track changes in code and collaborate with team members. GitHub also hosts the project repository.
